# Full Stack web development project
This application is being developed for a university course called Full Stack web development @ ELTE

## Development guidelines
- The **app** folder should be where the routes are defined
- Any **components** which are **not route** components should be placed in the **app/ui** directory
- If something is neither a component or a route component, it should be placed in the **app/lib** directory
- The code **must be** clean and well-documented
- Each feature must go on a separate branch, and will only be merged when it was **reviewed**
- Proper testing is inevitable
- The **git graph** must be kept clean
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
- DRY
- Boy Scout Rule
